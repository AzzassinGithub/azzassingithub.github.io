            <p>
                Heya, I'm Aaron. I'm a self taught developer with an interest in cyber security and marketing.

            <p>
                During my GCSE's, I wrote a program in python to help me with my revision. Since then I've created other scripts, like a hot potato game with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Bit" target="_blank">BBC microbit</a>. All the stuff I did for work is <a href="/exploits/">right over there.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the past, I've took part in CTFs and tried <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/1004847" target="_blank">bug hunting</a> on HackerOne, as well as using TryHackMe and HackTheBox to further improve my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the beginning of 2023, I earned my MBCS and RITTech in digital marketing after completing a level 3 digital marketing apprenticeship.
