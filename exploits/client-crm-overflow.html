            <h1>Preventing a client CRM from overflowing</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
                Our client had been using ActiveCampaign for a long time for customer journeys for better retention for their supplement products. 
                However, as they grew in size and the journeys became more complex, we needed to move over to a new CRM that was capable of supporting such a large journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                The timing was convenient, as they were nearing the contact limit which they paid ActiveCampaign for. 
                But as the customer journeys and data was being transferred over to the new system, we began receiving warnings from ActiveCampaign that they were getting dangerously close to their allowed contact limit.
            </p>
            <p>
                If an ActiveCampaign account goes over its allowed contacts, it won't work properly anymore, it will still hold contact data, but the automations won't run anymore, and in our case, that meant contacts customer journeys being cut off, which would severely impact revenue of our client.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
                The obvious solution was to migrate contacts that weren't in the customer journey, and delete them from the old system, that way, they wouldn't block the customer journey for those in it.
                Unforunately it wasn't that simple, as ActiveCampaign wouldn't let you bulk delete contacts, and there was no automation function to allow us to delete them by pushing them all into an automation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I came up with a solution to delete contacts that had been exported. Each time contacts were exported into a list, they contained a unique ID which referenced them in the system.
                ActiveCampaign said that you could use the API to request a contact to be deleted via the API.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wrote a python script, which upon being executed, would take a number of IDs from the exported file, and call ActiveCampaign to delete them, one at a time. 
                The script was very carefully coded not to go over the rate limit, and I tested it with a file of around 30,000 contacts (much more than required) to make sure it wouldn't crash after being overloaded with too much data.
            </p>
            <p>
                I rented a VPS, uploaded the script and exported data onto the VPS, and set a cronjob for the script to run often, and monitored the situation for a few minutes. 
                It worked as intended, the contact number slowly decreasing below to a safe level, preventing any issues with the automations running.
            </p>
            <p>
                Confident that the script was now running and keeping any issues from arising, I left the VPS to run in the background. 
                I replaced the data with exported data as needed, but we never ran into the issue again, and were able to migrate successfully.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Since this client was already paying around £1500 a month for 100,000 contacts, I assume 200,000 contacts would have been around £2500 following ActiveCampaign's pricing structure.
                Therefore, I calculate that I saved that client approximately £1000, as well as massive time savings from automating deletion of contacts would have also amounted to probably at least £210 from three hours of work.
