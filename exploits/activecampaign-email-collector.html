            <h1>Saving hours by using an API to collect email links</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
                When I was working in a marketing agency that managed customer journeys for clients, it wasn't unheard of for clients to come to us and tell us they'd rebranded something, a key piece of information in every email had changed, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's easy to edit emails in ActiveCampaign, however we had to go in through automations to access these emails, and due to the nature of these customer journeys automations being so long and complex, the automations would take minutes to load up, sometimes making chrome freeze up, and just end up wasting a lot of time.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
                One day, I was tasked to do this task and change the customer journey emails for a client. 
                This was a very complex journey, over hundreds of possible messages went into this journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had the idea to see if I could get links to all emails without having to load the automation in chrome each time, so I looked at the API. 
                ActiveCampaign had an API call that could get the ID of each email in an automation.
            </p>
            <p>
                In an ideal world, I could have made a script which edited every email in an automation, but some of these edits required manual intervention for every email to see if editing would make the email make no sense.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the merits of ActiveCampaign is it's very uniform in its API and interface URLs, meaning once you got the format for an email edit link, it was possible to create an edit link for another email provided you had the ID and ActiveCampaign account that email was on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, I could write a script that would take an ActiveCampaign account, an automation ID and API key, and then it would return edit links for every email in an automation, without having the load the automation every time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wrote a script in Python, collecting a list of every email and printing each one out along with their name. 
                This was a breath of fresh air since I wasn't constantly looking at 'Google Chrome is not responding' while working.
            </p>
            <p>
                I sent a message to the business chat saying that I had some code that could generate a list of URLs for whenever we needed to work on every email in a journey. 
                The CEO said it was a good idea, but he was wondering if it was possible to create a web version of the system so someone could use it if I was unavailable, so I looked into it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Sometime later, I had a realisation that we had Gravity Forms on our website which had a lot of support for custom development. 
                After looking into the documentation, I realised there was a very useful WordPress filter, which was designed to modify the output based on the input.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started messing around with it and discovered this filter could output pure HTML and not just text. 
                So I started working on some HTML to display the same info the python program could.
            </p>
            <p>
                After recreating all the Python API calls in PHP, I created a form which would take the automation URL and API key of the account. 
                Like I said before, ActiveCampaign is very uniform in its URL formatting, meaning I could extract the account name and automation ID from the automation URL.
            </p>
            <p>
                When someone put the relevant details into the API form, it would process for around 10 seconds, and return a list of emails. 
                The emails came back in a HTML table, providing the name, the URL to edit them, and a checkbox which was a handy reminder of which emails had been modified.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The email collector has come in useful countless times now, and thankfully due to Gravity Forms customization options, provides documentation on how to use it right next to each text box, even providing links to get the API keys.
            </p>
            <p>
                It usually takes two minutes to make changes to an email, but sometimes it can take three minutes to load an automation to the point of being able to access an email.
            </p>
            <p>
                The approximate time savings for changing twenty emails are as follows :
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Manually:</b> 3 minutes of loading the email + 2 minutes of changing the email * 20 emails = 100 minutes or 1 hour and 40 minutes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Using collector:</b> 0.1 minutes to access the form in another tab and open the link + 2 minutes of changing the email * 20 emails = 42 minutes
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
